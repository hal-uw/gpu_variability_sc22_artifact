This package implements GPU optimizations of various LAMMPS styles.

Section 5.3.1 on the manual gives details of what hardware and Cuda
software is required on your system, and full details on how to build
and use this package.  See the KOKKOS package, which also has
GPU-enabled styles.

This package uses an external library provided in lib/gpu which must
be compiled before making LAMMPS.  See the lib/gpu/README file and the
LAMMPS manual for information on building LAMMPS with external
libraries.  The settings in the Makefile.lammps file in that directory
must be correct for LAMMPS to build correctly with this package
installed.

The GPU package and its associated library was created by Mike Brown
while at Sandia and ORNL, and by Trung Nguyen while at ORNL.
